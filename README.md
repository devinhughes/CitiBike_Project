Summary 

From the data we are able to tell what kind of fares will be requested based on what city type the passenger is located in. Based on the data have a great grasp on what fares will look like week to week based on city type information decide on rates that may need to be charged. In conclusion we can assess that a rural area will on adverage bring higher fare because there are fewer workers offering rides to the area.

Recommendations
1: Charge more per mile in urban cities because trips on adverage are a shorter distance.
2: Adjust fare pricing in accordence based on demand.
